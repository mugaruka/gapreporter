My name is Pacifique Mugaruka Ntabaza.

My interests lie where technology, development and data meet. I enjoy communicating with data on topical issues around poverty, vulnerability, crisis and financing for development.

This blog provides a platform for evidence to be shared to assist those advocating for a prosperous Democratic Republic of Congo in particular and Africa in general. The focus is on using evidence and data to bolster the case being made to politicians, development actors, businesses and society as a whole to be doing more to address the challenge of poverty and inequality. I believe that the same algorithms and techniques that companies use to boost profits can be leveraged by mission-driven organizations to improve the world, from battling hunger to advocating for child well-being and more.

Also featured are geographic data, cartographic maps, remote sensing, spatial analysis with R, Python and QGIS.

All opinions expressed on this blog are my own and are not intended to represent those of my employers past or present.
